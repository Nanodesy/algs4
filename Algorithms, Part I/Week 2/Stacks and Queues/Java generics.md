#  Question  3. Java generics. Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.

It's because Java's arrays (unlike generics) contain, at runtime, information about its component type. So you must know the component type when you create the array. Since you don't know what T is at runtime, you can't create the array. If generic array creation were legal, then compiler generated casts would correct the program at compile time but it can fail at runtime, which violates the core fundamental system of generic types.
